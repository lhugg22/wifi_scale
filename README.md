This file is for making an automated wifi scale using a HX711 connected to 4 50kg load cells connected to ESP8266


About to test the configuration of the scale talking to ESP8266. Initially I am going to have it work standalone
	this will run on a very simple webinterface that can be connected to locally. Maybe later on will change it
	to a web server so measurements can be read remotely.

Status:
	first commit
